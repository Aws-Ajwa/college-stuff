    ! the <html></html> it is the root tag that is mandatory tag to the html code structure
    ! the <head></head> tag contains the title of the page and the metaData
    // the <head></head> tag  may contain the CSS and JS codes but not usually
    ! the <title></title> tag its the name of the html page tap
    ! the <body></body> tag contains the page content (text , images , ...)
    // the <body></body> tag usually contain the CSS and JS codes
    // the <body></body> may contain a text directly but it will format it at the (top left of the page)
    ? the tags have two types :
    ~ 1) self-closing tags <.../>
    ~ 2) open-close tags <...></...>
    ~ 3) self-closing tags with attributes <... attributes/>

    ? Paths:
    ! 1) full/absolute path : its the full thing starting from the disk to the file extension.
    ! 2) relative path : its like moving locale within our pages to link things relatively to each other
    // the relative path is usually used with images and pages in this case you don't need to write the full path
    ! the relative path has four cases :
    ~ 1) the image and the page are in the same folder :
          !<img src = "image.jpg"/>
    ~ 2) the image was one level outside the page folder :
          !<img src = "../image.jpg"/>
    ~ 3) the image was one level inside the page folder :
          !<img src = "folderName/image.jpg"/>
    ~ 4) the image was on the Root folder directly and the page in any folder :
          !<img src = "/image.jpg"/>
    % when putting a src in the image tag we don't use (.jpeg) instead we use (.jpg)???
    ??? the relative path works with image and pages and with page and page

    ? lists has Three types :
    ~ 1. Order List: is used for lists of items for which the order of the items does matter. 
      ! the <ol></ol> tag its the main tag of the ordered list
      ! the <li></li> tag it is the items of the list 
      // the ordered list item attributes:
      // 1) the type attribute it could take (1 (the default) , a , A , i , I)
      // 2) the reversed attribute it will reverse the numbering of the list
      // 3) the start attribute it will state at what number the list will Start
      % in the start attribute if you exceeded the number of letters it will do this (aa , ab , ...) 
    ~ 2. Unordered List: is a list in which the order of the list items does not matter.
      ! the <ul></ul> tag its the main tag of the unordered list
      ! the <li></li> tag it is the items of the list 
      // the unordered list item attributes:
      // 1) the type attribute it could take (disc (the default) , circle , square , none)
    ~ 3. Definition List: A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
      ! the <dl></dl> tag its the main tag of the Definition list
      ! the <dt></dt> tag it is the items of the list 
      ! the <dd></dd> tag it is the description of items in the list

    ? Links Or HyperLinks : when you move your mouse to it it will turn into a little hand
    // there is Three uses of the hyperLinks:
      ~ 1) to Jump from a page to a page locale on the same website.
      ~ 2) to Jump from the page to an external page from a website to another website.
      ~ 3) to Jump from a part to any other part of the same page.
    ! the hyperLink tag is <a></a> referees to anchor (مرساة)  
    ! <a> (text , image , ....)-> this is the visible part of the link </a> 
    // note : 
    // By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers): 
       ? An unvisited link is underlined and blue 
       % A visited link is underlined and purple 
       ! An active link is underlined and red
    // the anchor tag attributes :
    // 1) href : we insert the path of the whatever here (relative or absolute).
    // if the href was empty it the link will appear like a regular text.
    // 2) target : this attribute specifies where to open link tab
       % a) _self : this value will override the same tab (the default).
       % b) _Blank : this value will open a new tab.
       % c) iframeName : this value will open the tap in an internal window called (Iframe).
    ? Bookmarks:
    ! a Bookmark is used to jump from a specific part to a specific part in the web page.
    ! the Bookmark also can be used to jump to a specific part in an external page.
    // 1) you will need to give the targeted part of tag an id with the id attribute.
    // 2) in the href attribute you will need to write :
    ~   <a href = "#id"> (text , image , ...) </a> 
    //  -> if it was in the same page.
    ~   <a href = "(fullPath or relativePath)#id"> (text , image , ...) </a>

    ? the mail Links :
    ! <a href = "mailto:mymail@gmail.com?Subject=anything"> (text , image , ...) </a>
    // this link will open the mail application to use it with the same mail.
    % you need to write it exactly the same (important).

<!--
   ? the iFrame and its attributes: its an internal window inside our page.
   ! <iframe></iframe>
   // we use it to open an external (using src) or internal (using name) page within our page. 
   // iframe tag attributes :
   // 1) name : the name that we use to call the iframe in the link tag.
   // 2) width : the iframe width.
   // 3) height : the iframe height.
   // 4) src : it takes a image or url Path that will be the default site.

    ? Image Mapping : its like putting a clickable area in any Image that jump to some page
    ? Steps to do mapping to an image or using an image as a link:
    * 1) prepare your image
    * 2) prepare your page and your files
    * 3) create an Image tag with the attribute (usemap)
    * 4) create a map tag
    ! <img src = "The image Path" usemap = "#mapName"/>
    ? the map tag : we use it to locate the clickable areas and there shapes
    // map tag attributes : 
    // 1) name : its the name that we need to use in the usemap attribute.
    // area tag attributes:
    // 1) shape : it specifies the Targeted shape it could be
     ~ 1) circle
     ~ 2) rect 
     ~ 3) poly
     ~ 4) default : Specifies the entire Image as a clickable area 
    // 2) coords : it takes the coordinates of the specified shape.
    // 3) href : it takes Path or Url Link to jump when clicked on the shape. 
    // 4) alt : this is the text that will appear if the image cant load for any reason.
    // 5) title : its the text that appears when moving your mouse on your shape.
    % to make it work right you cant change the width or the hight of the main image.

    ! <map name ="anyName">
    !   <area shape="rect" coords="Top , Left , Right , Bottom" href="Url or Path" alt="anyText" title="anyText">

    ? Tables : in the past before CSS tables was used to divide Pages as a Layout.
    ! <table> (text , image , table , iframe , ...) </table> : the main table tag.
    ! <tr> </tr> : the row tag it could have th or td tags.
    ! <th> (text , image , table , ...) </th> : the Heading cells tag (it will make content Bold and Center).
    ! <td> (text , image , table , ...) </td> : the data cells tag (it will make content unBold and left).
    ! <caption> ... </caption> : its a tag that will work as a title of the table. (only one)
    
    ! <thead> <tr> <th> </th> ... </tr> </thead>  : tag is used to group header content in an HTML table. 
    ! <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> ... </tr> </tbody> : tag is used to group the body content in an HTML table.

    - this is clearly the radio buttons to prevent the user from choosing more then one button we can 
      give all of them the same value to the name attribute.
    - we use the checked attribute to make the radiobutton checked as the default one.
    - here we use the value to distinguish between the user choices.
  ! <input type = "checkbox" name = "CB1" value = "C1" checked /> CB1 = C1
  ! <input type = "checkbox" name = "CB2" value = "C2"/> CB2 = C2
  ! <input type = "checkbox" name = "CB3" value = "C3"/> CB3 = C3
    - this is clearly the checkboxes we use this to allow the user to select multiple choices.
    - we use the checked attribute to make the checkbox will be checked as the default one.
    - here we use the value to distinguish between the user choices.

     - don't forget to write the method = "Post" and enctype = "multipart/form-data" in the form tag
     % the multiple attribute is to allow user to upload more then one file.
     % the accept attribute in the allowed type of files it could take:
     % (.anyFileExtension , .anyFileExtension , (image/*) , (video/*) , (audio/*))
  // the textArea tag : we use it to allow user to enter more then one line of text.

    <option value = "text4"> ... </option>
  </select>
  - the multiple attribute is to allow user to select more then one item using CTRL.
  - if we used the multiple attribute we need to write a [] in the name to send all choices as an array.
  -- if we didn't write [] it will override all items with the last selected item to send it.
  - the size attribute is the visible item to the user before he open the list
  -- the default value of the size is 1 if the multiple attribute is written it will be 4.
  - if you didn't write the value attribute the visible text to the user will be sent to the server.
  ? the three validation attributes :
  ! 1) type 
  ! 2) maxLength , MinLength
  ! 3) Required : we use it to force the user to enter the data before submitting
       - the only type that is forced without the required is the email.
  ~ any component that don't have a name the backend application or the server can't identify it. 
  ~ in the dropDownList without the multiple attribute its like a radio and with it its like a checkbox
  ~ in the dropDownList the name is for the select tag and the value is for the option tag.
  ~ the name attribute is like a variable that takes the value attribute when submitting or the visible text.
