Assignment Title: Android SQLite Database Integration

Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to implement SQLite database integration in an Android application. Students are expected to create a simple Android app that utilizes SQLite to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.



Requirements:

Database Schema:

Define a simple database schema related to a specific theme (e.g., a library system, a task manager, a contacts app, etc.).

Include at least two tables with a meaningful relationship between them.

Tables should have primary keys, and relationships (if any) should be appropriately established using foreign keys.

User Interface:

Create a user interface with appropriate elements (e.g., buttons, text fields, lists) to interact with the SQLite database.

Implement separate screens for adding new records, viewing records, updating records, and deleting records.

SQLite Database Operations:

Implement the necessary Java classes to perform CRUD operations on the SQLite database.

Ensure that database operations are encapsulated in a separate class or classes (e.g., a DatabaseHelper class).

Handle exceptions and errors gracefully.

Functionality:

Add functionality to insert new records into the database.

Implement a feature to display a list of records from the database.

Enable users to update existing records.

Implement a feature to delete records.



Example of database :

Task Manager Android App

Database Schema:

Tasks Table:

task_id (Primary Key, Integer)

task_name (Text)

due_date (Text or Date)

category_id (Foreign Key referencing Categories Table)

Categories Table:

category_id (Primary Key, Integer)

category_name (Text)

User Interface:

Create a user interface with the following screens:

Add Task:

Fields for entering task name, due date, and selecting a category.

A button to add the task to the database.

View Tasks:

Display a list of tasks with their details (name, due date, category).

Each task item should have options to update and delete the task.

Add Category:

A screen to add new categories to the database.

View Categories:

Display a list of categories.

Each category item should have options to update and delete the category.

SQLite Database Operations:

Implement Java classes to handle CRUD operations:

TaskManagerDatabaseHelper:

Create the SQLite database and tables.

Implement methods for adding, updating, deleting, and querying tasks.

CategoryManagerDatabaseHelper:

Implement methods for adding, updating, deleting, and querying categories.

Functionality:

Add Task:

Insert a new task with a due date and associated category.

View Tasks:

Display a list of tasks.

Allow users to update and delete tasks.

Add Category:

Insert a new category.

View Categories:

Display a list of categories.

Allow users to update and delete categories.
